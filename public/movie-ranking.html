<h1>The Best Movies According to Mike</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>IP Man</h3>
<p>This is my favorite martial art movie by Donnie Yen. <br > It's has 4 parts altogether and I was thrilled by the action and the plot of the movie. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves martial movies.</p>
<h3>Fast and Furious</h3>
<p>I have a die hard love for Vin diesel. The featured actors and actresses is mind blowing.</p>
<h3>Heart of Stone 2023</h3>
<p>After watching Fast X this year and as I anticipate the release of the concluding part, I haven't found another good movie that suit my taste till I saw this movie. Gal Gadot was on fire</p>
<h3>What do you think of my list?</h3>
